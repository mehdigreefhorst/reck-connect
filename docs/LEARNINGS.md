# Learnings

Append per feature/phase: **What we learned**, **Surprises**, **Decisions**.

## Transcript view: TTS + Cmd-click + chat-start (follow-up to #51/#52, 2026-07-05)

Bringing the History overlay to feature-parity with the terminal / popout /
file-viewer by reusing existing components. Plan in
`.claude/plans/claude-transcript-view-enhancements.md`.

### Phase 1 — parser: harness-wrapper sanitization

**What we learned**
- A Claude session's opening is not "user prose → Claude reply". Real
  transcripts inject non-conversational **`role:"user"` strings**: a
  `<local-command-caveat>` preamble, `<task-notification>` background events,
  `<system-reminder>` blocks, and slash commands as
  `<command-name>…</command-name>` (sometimes with `<command-message>` /
  `<command-args>` / `<local-command-stdout>` siblings). Verified live across 8
  station transcripts: openings split ~PROSE 60, task-notification 13,
  local-command-caveat 11, command-name 11, local-command-stdout 10,
  system-reminder 8.
- The parser now runs `sanitizeUserString()` on string user content: captures
  the slash command as a slim `{ kind: "command", name }` block, strips every
  known wrapper (closed *or* run-to-end-of-message), and keeps whatever prose
  survives. A line that reduces to nothing is **skipped** — no phantom "You"
  turn.

**Surprises**
- Slash commands often arrive **standalone** (`<command-name>/model</command-name>`
  with no siblings), not as the combined `/clear`+message+args blob — so the
  sanitizer can't assume the sibling wrappers are present.
- A skipped noise line must **not** reset the open assistant turn. A mid-turn
  `<task-notification>` would otherwise split Claude's single turn in two, so
  the pure-noise path returns `null` *without* clearing `openAssistant`.

**Decisions**
- New `command` block kind (vs. dropping slash commands) so `/clear`, `/model`,
  `/compact` stay visible as the "how the chat opens" signal — rendered as a
  pill in Phase 2, not a prose bubble.
- Wrapper stripping is deliberately tolerant: unknown tags pass through as text
  (the JSONL schema is not a public API).

### Phase 2 — view: session divider, command pills, user-turn linkify

**What we learned**
- The `a.reck-internal-link` anchor-wrapper the file viewer uses is a private
  `wrapFreeTextPaths(root)` inside `MarkdownRenderer.ts`. Exporting it (vs.
  re-deriving via the already-exported `detectPathsInLine`) lets user prose
  turns get the *exact* same anchors — same class, same `⌘+click to open`
  tooltip, same skip rules — so Phase 3's single delegated handler covers user
  and assistant turns uniformly.
- Command blocks render inline as a slim pill (`.transcript-command`), branched
  in `renderTurn` before the tool-group fold — a `/clear` is user intent, not
  tool activity, so it must not land in the `<details>` tool group.

**Surprises**
- Assistant turns were already visually linkified (the `wrapFreeTextPaths` pass
  runs unconditionally inside `md.mount`), but user turns were raw `.textContent`
  with no anchors at all — so "make paths clickable" needed a *view* change
  (wrap user text), not just a click handler.

**Decisions**
- The start-of-session divider is a permanent first body child, hidden via
  `--hidden` until the first turn renders (so a loading/empty overlay doesn't
  claim a session began). Shows the short 8-char session id when provided.

### Phase 3 — Cmd+click opens any path

**What we learned**
- One delegated `click` listener on `.transcript-body` (not per-turn handlers)
  is the right seam: it survives incremental appends and dodges the
  `MarkdownRenderer.mount()` detach — a single shared renderer keeps a live
  listener only on the *last-mounted* turn, so relying on it would make only
  the newest Claude turn clickable.
- The handler matches **any** `a[href]`, not just `.reck-internal-link`, and
  always `preventDefault()`s — otherwise a plain click on a file href would
  navigate the Electron window. Opening requires ⌘, matching the terminal +
  file-viewer linkifiers.
- The controller stays free of reckAPI/cwd knowledge: it takes a
  `linkHandlers(host)` dep and forwards the result to the view. boot.ts builds
  the handler from the exact pane-linkifier pipeline (`resolveActivatePath` +
  `openInViewer` with `sourceHost`/`projectCwd`); popout passes the raw href
  and lets main resolve (a detached window has no project cwd).

**Surprises**
- The map agent reported markdown native links carry `reck-internal-link`; in
  fact the `link_open` override adds the class **only for internal hrefs**
  (`isInternalLinkHref`). External links are bare `<a>` — hence the broadened
  `a[href]` selector.
- There is **no** renderer-side reckAPI bridge to `shell.openExternal`, and the
  file viewer itself never wires `onExternalActivate`. So external links are
  preventDefaulted (no navigation) but not opened — consistent with the viewer.
  `onExternalActivate` is left plumbed for a future preload bridge.

## Codex preamble via `developer_instructions` (follow-up to #33, 2026-07-01)

Undeferred the #32 preamble for codex after web-researching the actual `codex` CLI.

**What we learned**
- The `codex` CLI has **no** `--append-system-prompt` flag (feature request openai/codex#11117 was closed unimplemented), but its generic `-c`/`--config` override sets **`developer_instructions`**, documented in `codex-rs/config/src/config_toml.rs` as *"inserted as a `developer` role message."* It's per-launch, non-invasive (no repo write / no `AGENTS.md` clobber), append-not-replace, and works for the interactive TUI — the clean analog to Claude's `--append-system-prompt`.
- The per-project preamble the user edits in the UI (project dialog / right-click) persists as `Project.Preamble` — the exact field the adapter injects, so codex honours it with zero extra plumbing.

**Surprises**
- The alternatives are all worse: `model_instructions_file` **replaces** the base prompt (officially discouraged), project `AGENTS.md` mutates the repo, `CODEX_HOME`/`--profile` are global user state, and there's **no** instruction-carrying env var. So the single `-c developer_instructions=` override is *the* mechanism.
- `argv_redact.go` didn't cover `-c key=value` (its equals-branch requires a `--` prefix), so the multi-KiB preamble would have flooded logs — extended it.

**Decisions**
- Inject **global + project** layers only; **exclude** the daemon baseline (`BaseStationPreamble`) because it's Claude-shaped ("Claude Code pane" + Claude hooks). Revisit if the baseline is generalised.
- Shipped as a **separate PR stacked on the first-class-codex branch**, grounded in the primary-source config key. **Not yet empirically verified** against a real codex binary (none installed on the Mac or Pi) — a one-line `codex -c developer_instructions=TESTMARKER` smoke-test on the station should confirm the key before relying on it in production.

## Codex first-class pane (issue #33, 2026-07-01)

Made the `codex` pane kind first-class: creatable from the New-pane dialog,
correctly labelled, and restart-durable — deferring only what depends on the
external `codex` CLI's (unverifiable) capabilities.

**What we learned**
- The audit of the 10 merged reck-connect PRs found **none** break a codex
  pane — every merged feature is agent-agnostic terminal/UI/connection
  machinery. The real gap was foundational: `codex` was a half-wired kind.
- The daemon spawn stack was already codex-complete (adapter registered,
  binary resolved, `default_pane="codex"` accepted). The *only* hard blocker
  to interactive create was a single allowlist line in `router.go`.
- **Shell is the template.** A shell pane — like codex — has no Claude
  session yet is creatable, labelled, and restart-durable via a disk-backed
  `SlotID` (`sessions.go` is file-backed; the renderer rekeys the saved tab
  by `slot_id`). Codex reuses the same `slot_id` field, so durability needed
  **no new proto field** — just codex arms alongside the existing shell arms.

**Surprises**
- There was **no** per-station capability signal at all (`/health` carried
  only status/version/uptime; `SupportedKinds()` lists codex unconditionally
  regardless of whether a binary exists). Advertising `codex_available` was
  the bulk of the "create" work — one boolean threaded proto → daemon →
  per-host renderer store → dialog.
- `defaultTabTitle` had only a `claude`/else arm, so every codex pane
  rendered as **"Shell"** in the tab bar and close dialogs.
- The codex adapter never read `ExtraArgs` validation like claude does; the
  dialog sends none, but admitting `kind=codex` to the HTTP API means a raw
  client could pass arbitrary codex flags (noted, not gated).

**Decisions**
- **Path A** (make codex first-class), not Path B (fence it off).
- Codex restore **replays the captured argv+cwd** (mirrors shell) rather than
  re-running the adapter fresh — keeps the "captured argv is the invariant"
  contract uniform across shell/codex.
- **Deferred** (no repo evidence the codex CLI supports them, so building
  blind would be speculative): the #32 preamble (`--append-system-prompt` is
  Claude-only; codex's convention is a filesystem `AGENTS.md`), `--resume`,
  the lifecycle-hook shim + rich stoplight (daemon side is already generic;
  only a `reck-codex-hook.sh` + installer are missing), and clipboard-image.
