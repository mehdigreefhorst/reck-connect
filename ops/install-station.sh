# install-station.sh — end-to-end V2 station install.
#
# Issue #215 phase 1: reck-stationd now runs as a per-user LaunchAgent
# (gui/<uid>/eu.verwey.reck-stationd) instead of a system-scope
# LaunchDaemon. Same Aqua context as local mode, same direct-spawn
# code path, no sidecar audit-session dance. Closes the resize-scramble
# divergence by making station = local at the OS-launch level.
#
# Must be run AS the reck-connect user (the user that will own the
# Aqua session the daemon runs inside). One-shot:
#   1. Build reck-stationd binary, install to /usr/local/bin (sudo).
#   2. Resolve / migrate the DAEMON_TOKEN; write to ~/.config/reck/token (0600).
#   3. Render LaunchAgent plist with HOME substitutions, install to
#      ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.
#   4. Tear down the old LaunchDaemon if present and rename the plist to
#      .disabled (rollback path).
#   5. Bootstrap the LaunchAgent in gui/<uid>.
#   6. Build + install the reck-clipboard sidecar (kept for phase 1 —
#      retired in a follow-up after the LaunchAgent migration is verified).
#   7. Verify auth + reachability.
#
# Migration note (issue #49 / #215): the token survives whatever its
# previous home was — old LaunchDaemon plist EnvironmentVariables, old
# /etc/reck-stationd/token, ENV_FILE, or generated fresh. End state:
# single value at ~/.config/reck/token, mode 0600, owned by reck-connect.

# Required config — RECK_STATION_USER and RECK_STATION_ROOT. Explicitly
# set env vars win; otherwise fall back to the values persisted by a
# prior successful run at ~/.config/reck/station.env, so re-installs
# don't need the variables retyped. Fail-fast if neither source has
# them. Mirrors install-satellite.sh: silent fallback to upstream
# defaults would let a misconfigured station serve projects under a
# path the satellite's translateStationCwd() doesn't recognize,
# vanishing them from the rail.

# Write a structured result file at $HOME/.reck-install-result.json so the

# tailscale ssh) can scp-pull it without screen-scraping the trailing
# "Satellite config:" block. Owner-readable only — it carries the daemon
# token and may carry the just-generated reck-connect account password
# (passed in via $RECK_CONNECT_PW from bootstrap-reck-user.sh).

# We use mkstemp + chmod-before-write + os.replace so the file is never
# briefly world-readable: a naive `open(...)` followed by `chmod` would
# leave a 0644 file (under the typical umask 022) on disk for the
# duration of the JSON write, racing with any process that polls the
