// Content zoom model — pure helpers, no Electron.
//
// Replaces Electron's built-in `role: "viewMenu"` zoom, which called
// `webContents.setZoomLevel` and therefore scaled the ENTIRE page. That is wrong
// for this app in two ways:
//
//   1. Every window is `titleBarStyle: "hiddenInset"`, so the macOS traffic
//      lights float over our own title bar. The lights are drawn by the OS at a
//      fixed size, so a title bar that grows on ⌘+ slides out of alignment with
//      them — visible as the close button crowding or overlapping the title.
//
//   2. A terminal is a canvas. Page zoom scales the rendered bitmap rather than
//      re-laying-out the grid, so glyphs soften and the PTY geometry no longer
//      matches what the user sees. Terminals are meant to be zoomed by font
//      size, which reflows properly.
//
// So zoom is now content-only: the renderer multiplies content font sizes by
// this factor and re-fits terminals, while title bars ignore it entirely.
