// `SearchSurfaceAdapter` — the single abstraction every searchable surface
// implements, mirroring the TTS subsystem's `SpeakSurfaceAdapter`.
//
// The `SearchController` consumes adapters rather than xterm / CodeMirror /
// the markdown DOM directly, so the search bar, the matcher, and all
// navigation logic are written once and reused across:
//
//   - TerminalSearchAdapter   — xterm panes (main window + detached popout)
//   - MarkdownSearchAdapter    — file-viewer markdown body (CSS Custom Highlight)
//   - CodeMirrorSearchAdapter  — file-viewer CodeMirror surface (decorations)
//
// Matching is performed by `matcher.ts` over the adapter's flat `getText()`.
// The resulting `OffsetRange`s are in flat-text character offsets; each
// adapter knows how to map an offset range back to its own coordinate
// system (xterm buffer cell, CodeMirror doc position, or DOM Range) for
// highlighting and scrolling.
