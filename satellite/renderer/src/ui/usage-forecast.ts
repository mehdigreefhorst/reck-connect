// Geometry for the quota burn-rate forecast (issue #130). Pure math — no
// DOM, no uPlot, no canvas — so every case here is unit-testable with plain
// numbers. The painting lives in usage-forecast-paint.ts.
//
// The RATES are not computed here. They arrive on the histogram response,
// derived by the daemon from raw quota_samples, because the binned series
// this view plots is too coarse to fit at anything but Day/5m and its last
// value is a forward-filled per-bin MAX() rather than a reading. This
// module only turns three rates into three polylines in the chart's index
// space, and works out where they cross 100%.
//
// Index space, not time: uPlot is fed bin indices (see usage-view.ts), and
// bins are evenly spaced for every fixed-width bucket, so an instant maps to
// a fractional index by (t - firstBin) / width. The chart's own bin array
// already extends past `now` to the end of the period — the daemon emits
// dense bins across the whole range and simply leaves quota null after now —
// so the forecast fills slots that already exist rather than inventing them.
