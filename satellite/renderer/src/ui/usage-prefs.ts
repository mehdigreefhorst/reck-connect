// Remembered state for the usage overlay.
//
// Reopening the overlay used to drop the user back on Week / default bins /
// all-projects / everything-visible, no matter what they were looking at. This
// module is the pure half of fixing that: what gets remembered, and how a
// persisted blob is sanitized back into usable state.
//
// WHAT IS REMEMBERED — the shape of the view:
//   which view was open (granularity, or the Session window), the bin width
//   PER granularity, the project filter, and which series are toggled on.
//
//   Bin width is per-granularity because it is not one preference, it is one
//   per view: "1 minute" is a considered choice on Day and not offered at all
//   on Year. A single remembered width meant picking 1m on Day and glancing at
//   Week threw the choice away, since coming back ran the Day default.
//
// WHAT IS NOT — where in time you were:
//   The anchor date is deliberately dropped. Reopening a "Day" view should show
//   TODAY, not whichever day you happened to be paging through last week; the
//   remembered thing is "I look at usage a day at a time, one minute per bin",
//   not "I was looking at 3 March". Drag-zoom ranges are dropped for the same
//   reason — a zoom is a gesture, not a preference.
//
// Everything here is defensive: the blob comes back from disk and may be from
// an older release, hand-edited, or truncated. Any unusable field falls back to
// its default rather than propagating (a bad bin width would otherwise reach the
// daemon as a query parameter).
