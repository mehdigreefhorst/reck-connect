// Burn-rate forecasting for the rate-limit windows.
//
// The Satellite draws three projected lines from "now" to the window's
// reset: a centre and two bounds. All three rates are computed HERE, from
// raw quota_samples, rather than in the renderer from the binned histogram.
// That is the whole point of this file, for three reasons:
//
//   - Bin width stops mattering. A 90-minute trailing window gives the
//     renderer ~18 points at Day/5m but only 3 at Week/30m — too few to fit
//     anything trustworthy. The raw table has ~90 readings for the same span
//     whatever the caller is plotting.
//   - The projection origin is exact. The plotted series is a per-bin MAX()
//     that is then forward-filled, so anchoring a forecast on its last value
//     projects from a peak, and from one up to a bin-width stale.
//   - The wire stays tiny: six numbers per bucket instead of raw rows.
//
// The bounds are NOT a confidence interval and must not be presented as one.
// They are the 10th and 90th percentile of the burn rates this account has
// actually sustained — "if you keep working at your slowest / fastest
// observed pace". The centre is the median of the same sample.

//	7d — "will I run out this week?" A seven-day window spans nights and

	// intervals alternate between catching the working stretch and catching
	// the night, so half the sample is zero and the median collapses toward
	// it; a ~24-hour span always contains one of each and lands on the
	// day's real average.
	//
	// Sized by the reporting resolution, not by taste. Upstream reports
	// whole percentages (see quota_poll_test.go's captured response), so
	// the 7d series is a 1-point staircase. A real weekly burn of ~0.2 %/h
	// moves less than a tenth of a point in half an hour — far under that
	// step — so at the 5h rule EVERY 7d interval is either exactly flat
	// (dropped) or one whole step over ~5 minutes, which reads as 12 %/h.

	// A day, by contrast, carries ~5 points of rise, so a 1-point step is a
